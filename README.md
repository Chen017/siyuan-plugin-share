### 🛠️ Branch Change Description

#### Introduced **Lite Mode**, which will:

- Disable features such as comments, reports, banned words, SMTP, CAPTCHA, registration, ICP, share link prefixes, and back-end user management.
- Streamline the share page: hide creation time, report button, comment section, and visit counts.
- Streamline the back-end page: remove the administrator entry card at the bottom of the dashboard and hide entry points for disabled features.
