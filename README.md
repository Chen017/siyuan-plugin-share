### 🛠️ Branch Changes

This branch introduces a **Lite Mode** toggle. Once enabled, it implements the following changes:

#### 1. Feature Deactivation

The following features are disabled to ensure a minimalist approach:

* **Interaction**: Comments and Reporting system.
* **Backend Services**: SMTP functions, CAPTCHA, and ICP filing number display.
* **Content Control**: Banned words filtering.
* **User Management**: Registration is disabled; user management is restricted to `admin` only.
* **Link Optimization**: Removed share link prefix.

#### 2. UI Simplification

* **Share Page**: Hidden creation time, report button, comment section, and visit counter.
* **Console**: Removed the admin entry card at the bottom of the console for a cleaner look.
